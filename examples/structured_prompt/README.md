# ðŸ§± Agentic AI â€“ Structured Prompt Demo

This project demonstrates how to build a **structured agent** using Spring AI and Kotlin â€” where each agent follows a clearly defined **role**, **goal**, **style**, and **context**.

Instead of just throwing arbitrary messages at the LLM, this demo explores a cleaner and more modular approach inspired by **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **agentic design principles**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Why Structured Prompts?

In many LLM-based systems, you just throw a question into a generic assistant and hope for the best.

This demo does something different: it **wraps the agent in identity and purpose**.

Each request is constructed with a structured prompt like:

```
Role: Patient Instructor  
Goal: Explain complex topics to non-experts  
Style: Friendly and clear  
Context: User is new to Agentic AI
```

This gives the model a **consistent personality** and **limits scope creep**.

It also allows you to:

- Swap between agent personas easily
- Reuse structured behavior
- Log or audit prompt configurations
- Chain agents together with clear hand-offs

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally (with a model like `llama3` downloaded):

   ```bash
   ollama run llama3
   ```

2. Run the Spring Boot app:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

3. Visit this endpoint in your browser or with curl:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/structured-prompt/0
   ```

   This sends a standard question:
   ```
   What is Agentic AI, and how is it different from regular AI assistants?
   ```

   â€¦to an agent defined by the selected index (e.g. index 0 = "Patient Instructor").
